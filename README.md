# hotlapdavilla_wp
This small but effective Wordpress plugin controls the Hotlap da Villa (automobilistic event) ecommerce system, applying specific discounts and offers given certain conditions.

This simple plugin is constantly updated as the event organizers change their needs and demands. The most recent change is they requested a QR Code to be printed on a certain page inside their Wordpress system which presents certain data regardin a racer's information (CPF/social security ID, ticket payment status, ticket #).
This plugin was developed by me and 'donated' to the company where I am the CTO: https://austersoftware.com/
